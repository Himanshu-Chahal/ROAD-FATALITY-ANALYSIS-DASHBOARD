Data-Driven Insights into Road Fatalities: My Latest Excel Dashboard Project
I'm excited to share my recent project—an interactive Excel dashboard developed using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) 2021 dataset from data.gov.
Project Objective:
 To analyze and visualize key patterns in fatal road accidents across the United States, with the goal of supporting data-informed decisions to improve road safety.
Key Dashboard Insights:
State-wise fatality analysis using an interactive map chart
Comparison between person and pedestrian fatalities
Top 5–6 leading causes of fatal crashes, including speeding and alcohol involvement
Rural vs urban crash analysis
Impact of weather conditions and time of day on crash severity
Tools and Techniques Used:
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Query, Slicers, Map Charts)
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Interactive and insightful data visualization design
This project helped me deepen my skills in data cleaning, dashboard creation, and translating raw data into actionable insights.
