Data-Driven Insights into Road Fatalities: My Latest Excel Dashboard Project

I'm excited to share my recent project—an interactive Excel dashboard developed using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) 2021 dataset from data.gov.


✨Project Objective:
🚀 To analyze and visualize key patterns in fatal road accidents across the United States, with the goal of supporting data-informed decisions to improve road safety.


✨Key Dashboard Insights:
☑️State-wise fatality analysis using an interactive map chart

☑️Comparison between person and pedestrian fatalities

☑️Top 5–6 leading causes of fatal crashes, including speeding and alcohol involvement

☑️Rural vs urban crash analysis

☑️Impact of weather conditions and time of day on crash severity


✨Tools and Techniques Used:
☑️Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Query, Slicers, Map Charts)
☑️Data preprocessing and feature engineering
☑️Interactive and insightful data visualization design


✨This project helped me deepen my skills in data cleaning, dashboard creation, and translating raw data into actionable insights.
